I'm just learning Python with making MMORPG game in console (version 1.0)

What's done: ("-" - Future functions, "+" - Already implement)
+ Simple console menu
+ Making a character:
  + Name, sex, races and classes
  - Future functions: professions
+/- Fighting system
+ First enemy
- Save/Load option
- Online
- Backpack system
- And a lot more

Next step is evolving game to 2D setup (version 2.0)
